Workforce Analytics System
Overview

This project is an end-to-end business analytics solution designed to help management gain visibility into workforce costs, employee performance, and departmental revenue contribution. The system consolidates fragmented data into a structured analytics pipeline to support data-driven decision-making.

Business Problem

Management lacks a consolidated view of workforce data due to information being scattered across multiple spreadsheets. This leads to reactive decision-making, inefficient resource allocation, and limited insight into operational performance.

Project Objectives

Integrate workforce, performance, and revenue data into a single analytical system

Identify cost inefficiencies and performance gaps across departments

Enable management to make informed workforce optimisation decisions

Key Business Questions

Which department generates the highest revenue per employee?

Which departments have high costs but low performance?

How does employee performance relate to salary levels?

Are there signs of overstaffing or inefficiency in certain departments?

What actionable insights can management use to improve productivity?

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (pandas) – Data cleaning and transformation

SQL – Data modelling and analytical queries

Power BI – Interactive dashboards and visual insights

Excel – Initial data exploration and validation
